                                                    Simple Shell Implementation

/******************************************************----Program Flow----*****************************************************************/


Function Wise Explanation of the main c program (shell.c):

	main() -----> takeInput() // Taking input from command line
	  |
	  |
	  ----------> processString() // parse the whole string in smaller strings depending on space and redirection(>/>>) operators
	  |		  |
	  |		  ------->parseSpace() // Extractig the individual words from the entire strings
	  |		  |
	  |		  -------->parseOp() // Divide the whole string in two strings which are divided by >/>> operator 
	  |
	  |
	  |
	  |
	  ----------> execArgs() // executing commands which have no redirection operators
	  |
	  |
	  ----------> execArgsRedirect() // executing commands which have redirection operators
	  
	  
Note: The function execArgs() and execArgsRediect() executing the command by spawning a child process which will execute a local object file for that command using exexvp() system call.

The commands Implemented are:
	"cd"   : built-in command
	"exit" : built-in command
	"help" : built-in command
	"mkdir": object file will be created "md"
	"cat"  : object file will be created "concat" 
	"top"  : object file will be created "top"
