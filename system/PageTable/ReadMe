                                                      Page Table Simulation

/******************************************************----Program Flow----*****************************************************************/


Function Wise Explanation of the c programs :

	OS.c : It will first create the page table in a shared memory and wait for the signal SIGUSR1, which is the signal to serve 		       the page fault, from the MMU.
	
	MMU.c : This program will attach the page table shared memory segmet in its address space and go on serve the requests for        			pages from different proceses.
	
	
	Control flow:
	
	MMU.c : looking for a page in the page table as per request <------------------

	 ---------------> page hit and serve the request                                                                   |

	 |If not present                                                                                                   |
	 ---------------> page miss and send signal SIGUSR1 to OS.c to service the page fault                              |
	                   |                                                                                               |

	                   ----> OS.c : catch the signal and  Serve the page fault as per the user's given choice of replacement policy
